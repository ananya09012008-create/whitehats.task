1) My name : Polisetti Ananya
2) I want to join whitehats to gain more knowledge in cybersecurity and get more exposure in this field. As a fresher I want to learn practical skills and work on real world security problems as well. I am very intrested in ethical hacking and looking forward to build strong technical skills.
